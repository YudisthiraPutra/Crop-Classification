This project focuses on crop classification, identifying crops such as rice, chickpea, and maize based on multiple features. The classification models used include Linear SVM, SVC with Polynomial Kernel, SVC with RBF Kernel, SVC with Sigmoid Kernel, and SVC with Linear Kernel. Additionally, the project employs various other models such as ANN, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree to enhance classification accuracy and robustness.
